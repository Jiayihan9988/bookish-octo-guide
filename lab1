1. Virtualization Technology Check
2. Cloud Computing
Fundamental reasons for cloud success:
Scalability and elasticity
Cost efficiency (pay-as-you-go model)
Accessibility and global availability
Rapid deployment and innovation
Three pros:
Reduced capital expenditure (no need for physical hardware)
High availability and disaster recovery capabilities
Automatic updates and maintenance
Three cons:
Potential security and privacy concerns
Dependency on internet connectivity
Possible vendor lock-in and unexpected costs
3. 
The primary function of a hypervisor is to create and run virtual machines by abstracting and managing
the host's hardware resources, allowing multiple guest operating systems to run concurrently on a 
single physical machine.
4. 
A virtual machine is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system 
and applications, sharing the resources of the host machine through a hypervisor.
5. 
Server consolidation and better resource utilization
Isolation and security between different environments
Cost savings on hardware and energy
Easy backup, recovery, and migration
Testing and development flexibility
6. 
Server virtualization for data centers
Development and testing environments
Running legacy applications on modern hardware
Desktop virtualization (VDI)
Cloud computing and SaaS offerings

10. Purpose of Cloning a Virtual Machine
The purpose of cloning a virtual machine is to create an exact copy of an existing VM, which is useful for:
Rapid deployment of identical environments
Backup and disaster recovery
Testing configurations without affecting the original VM
Scaling applications horizontally
