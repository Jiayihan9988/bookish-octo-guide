(a) Three Primary Cloud Service Models

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet
Software Development Example: A team uses AWS EC2 to deploy custom-configured development servers where 
they have full control over the operating system and middleware.
PaaS (Platform as a Service)

Provides platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications
Software Development Example: Developers use Heroku or Google App Engine to deploy web applications without 
worrying about underlying infrastructure management.
SaaS (Software as a Service)

Delivers software applications over the internet on subscription basis
Software Development Example: Teams use GitHub for version control, Slack for communication, and Jira for 
project management - all accessed via web browsers.

(b) Docker and Containerization

What is Docker?
Docker is a platform that uses containerization technology to package applications and their dependencies 
into isolated, portable containers.

Development Scenario
In a microservices architecture, Docker would be used to containerize each service (user authentication, 
payment processing, database, etc.). Each service runs in its own container with specific dependencies.

Contribution to Development/Deployment

Consistency: Eliminates "it works on my machine" problems
Isolation: Services don't interfere with each other
Portability: Containers run the same way on dev machines, testing environments, and production
Rapid Deployment: Easy to scale and update individual services
(c) n8n Deployment with Docker

Docker Command:

bash
docker run -d --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n n8nio/n8n

Command Explanation:

docker run: Create and start a new container
-d: Run in detached mode (background)
--name n8n: Name the container "n8n"
-p 5678:5678: Map host port 5678 to container port 5678
-v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n: Create volume for persistent data storage
n8nio/n8n: Use the official n8n Docker image
After running this command, you can access n8n at http://127.0.0.1:5678
